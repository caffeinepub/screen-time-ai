  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements well. REQ-1 (backend), REQ-2 (login), REQ-3 (dashboard with deterministic scores), REQ-6 (risk analysis), and REQ-7 (visual theme) are fully implemented. However, REQ-4 and REQ-5 use Recharts instead of react-chartjs-2/Chart.js as explicitly required, and the required Chart.js component registrations are absent. A ProfileSetupModal and authorization mixin were added without being requested.",
